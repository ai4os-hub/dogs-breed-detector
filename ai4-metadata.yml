title: Dogs breed detector
summary: Identify a dogs breed on the image (133 known breeds)
description: '"The application applies Transfer learning for dog''s breed identification, which is implemented by the means of Tensorflow and Keras:\n" "" "From a pre-trained CNN model (VGG16 | VGG19 | Resnet50 | InceptionV3 [1]) the last layer is removed," "then new Fully Connected (FC) layers are added, which are trained on the dog''s dataset." "" "The original dataset ([2]) consists of 8351 dog''s images for 133 breeds divided into: \n" "* training set (6680 pictures)" "* validation set (835)" "* test set (836)" "" "and amounts for **1080 MB** in zipped format (see the dataset link)."
